## Introduction
So, uh, I make wayyyy too many enemy systems. so i just made this to speed everything up. This is just a framework, but it makes coding enemy behavior and all the other giberish a lot easier for me, and for everyone. This runs on roblox's character controllers, which are extremally powerful, and I thought to build a NPC system revolving around these Character Controllers. thanks for using this ig
